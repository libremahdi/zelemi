; This example implements an infinite loop in the X86_64 architecture. 
; The EB instruction calculates the jmp based on the offset from the last byte of its own instruction, 
; specifically the last byte FE. To jump to the nop with three bytes, we need to go back: 
; two bytes for the jmp itself and one byte for executing the instruction that follows it.

90 ; nop
EB FD ; jmp -2
